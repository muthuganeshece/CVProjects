/*********** Deblur the optical image captured from scintillator *********/
Point Spread Function:
- Spread of point object in the optical image captured
- Represented as PSF

Motion Blur:
- Blurred Image = Correct Image * PSF

Image Deblur Techniques:
- Extracting the correct image from the blurred image
- Non Blind Deblur:
	- If PSF is known, simply applying a deconvolution returns the result
- Blind Deblur:
	- If PSF is unknown, first it needs to be estimated 

Work:
- Analyse images in ImageJ
- Adjust brightness to view the object in the image
- Apply flat field correction to extract the foreground image (Current image/Background image)
- Apply Gaussian filter
- Crop the region of interest
