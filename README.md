## Image Preprocessing
- Adjusted the brightness of 16-bit images for better visibility of the object
- Applied flat field correction to separate the foreground from the background
- Used a Gaussian filter for smoothing
- Binarized the image by applying thresholding techniques
  
## Estimation of Point Spread Function
